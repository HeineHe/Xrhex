# Rhex
#Advanced Actuation for Robots
#    This course introduces to students the basic structure, principle and working characteristics of common and cutting-edge
actuators in robotics, including electromagnetic motor, soft pneumatic actuator, hydraulic driver, piezoelectric motor,
electrostatic actuator, shape memory alloy, ion-exchange polymer metal composite (IPMC) and dielectric elastomer, etc.
This course committed to educating students with knowledge of the driving technologies mentioned above, to design and
analyse basic actuators, to further master the calculation methods of the key parameters of common actuators, and
finally, to select the appropriate actuators in the process of robot design. This course also aims to foster the capability of
innovation and academic writing and presentation, by develop new actuators from the basic principles.
#   In this program, we design a robot called Rhex, which is actuated by 6 Dji M3508 actuators.
#   Team members: Yifei Li, Yongshan Guo, Rui Guo, Rui HE(me)
What did I do?
Responsible for the preliminary discussion of the PID speed loop program, trying to complete the initial version of the speed loop C++ program; responsible for the design and improvement of the original version of the absolute encoder, and discuss with teammates the design of the encoder modification module after handover. 
Responsible for Rhex gait pattern research and literature video data collation, video editing of the overall work, video content includes previous discussions, medium-term work such as 3D printing and solidworks overall assembly video, as well as the operation results of the physical speed ring; find the appropriate 3M damping tape material pasted between the six legs of the robot.
